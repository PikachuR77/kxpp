Perhaps more ambitiously, he wishes to win back the voters the old party of Andrew Jackson has lost as of late. To do so, he will need to face the daunting task of making the ODP irrelevant, and in the process, he will likely meet an old foe.

Some wish for a comparitively centralized system, which they call "State Syndicalism". Meanwhile, those calling themselves "Orthodox Syndicalists" adopt a more mainstream approach for the ideology, and they advocate for labor unions to become the main forces in our economy. There are also those who want support "Decentralized Planning", a plan which would build on mainstream syndicalism and also see the creation of communes in cities and counties, generally having a utopian vision for the country. For now, these factions are united by famous union leader "Big Bill" Haywood, whose time in the Russian Civil War changed him and convinced him of the potential need for a revolution here as well. There are others who contend for leadership in the syndicalist faction as well. In the Centralist wing, there is legendary figure Jack Reed, who has garnered much support for the faction. There is also his disciple, James P. Cannon, the hero Arturo Giovannitti, West Coast socialist Harry Bridges, and writer Elmer Allison. In the Orthodox wing, there is fiery orator Frank T. Johns, rising star and "Rebel Girl" Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and journalist Robert "Fighting Bob" Minor.

These factions organize a small number of unions and, more-so, various social organizations to promote their utopian future where the population universally works towards the greater good and all are provided for.

This tenuous alliance did not last long, on the advent of the Russian Revolution many Georgia based members of the party decided to end their cooperation with the Russians, although some Georgians like Tsereteli remained faithful to Russian branch of the party.

This won them a great deal of support from the lower classes, and helped build a coalition with left-leaning and progressive parties throughout the Russian Empire. Following the Russian Revolution, the SSPRP joined forces with the Georgian social democrats and have been in a coalition ever since, but in time their agrarian focus has caused conflicts with the more urban, labour oriented policies adopted by the social democrats.

The KAPD (Communist Workers' Party) was formed in April 1920 as a split from the KPD based upon tactical and political differences, with the most important one being the KAPD's strong council-communist bent, anti-parliamentarianism and their tactics of 'leadership by example', decried as adventurist by the KPD majority. The KAPD's primary ally is the KAUD, formed in 1931 as a merger of the anti-trade union organisation AAUD (Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union Deutschland, General Workers' Union of Germany) and the AAUD-E (Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union – Einheitsorganisation, General Workers' Union of Germany - Unitary Organisation). Both the KAPD and KAUD express their support for 'Unionen', unions that are formed based upon economic regions, not trades, unlike the traditional 'Gewerkschaften'. These 'Unionen' are made out of factory organisations (Betriebsorganisationen, BO). They also both support the formation of a unitary organisation for the proletariat, however most agree that this is not possible currently and thus are willing to maintain the KAPD as a 'necessary evil' (the AAUD-E demanded immediate unification and thus split from the AAUD in 1921, which however after becoming fully decimated re-unified with the AAUD). The organisations insist that the revolution is not a task of a party, but the task of the proletariat, seeing the KAPD's role as merely being a catalyst for their action, with the task of the KAUD being meanwhile to fight against the traditional trade unions and take control of the workplaces.§!

The SPD was regularly fought by the conservative establishment, with the two most important ones being the suppression of the SPD under Bismarck and later Ludendorff. Before the First World War, the SPD was the strongest party in the Reichstag. During the War, however, the SPD split in two; the moderate MSPD and the more radical anti-war USPD. After a failed peaceful revolution in September 1918, both parties once more reconciled and reunited under the banner of the SPD. The SPD was the most vocal opponent of the Ludendorff dictatorship and the target of many government-instructed sanctions.    SPD representatives were present at the dismissal of the dictator and many people within the Empire attribute the fall of the dictatorship to them. Under Germany’s "second-greatest" chancellor, Alfred von Tirpitz, the SPD also has had to struggle against increasing levels of wealth among workers leading to decreased electoral output even in former core territories. The SPD's voter block is mostly among the lower classes and the industrial areas along the Rhine in the Kingdom of Saxony and in cities in Silesia, but Elsaß-Lothringen is also proving to be a hotbed of German social democracy, especially after the decline of the Zentrum and the ongoing centralisation efforts of the government.§!"

The Zentrum was opposed to the Ludendorff dictatorships, though it refrained from supporting protests.

The Northern Expedition may have failed, but the KMT remains underground and a powerful force in Liangguang. Chen Mingshu's Productive People's Party serves as a front for the remnants of the National Revolutionary's Fourth Army and the region's social-democratic politicians of the Party.

Founded in 1925, the party united disilusioned Kuomintang politicians and Overseas Chinese (especially Freemasons of the Hongmen), calling for the reform of the Republic of China into a proper federal state and multiparty democracy. While these hopes were quickly dashed by the Qing Restoration, they remain a significant force, albeit banned in Qing/Zhili-controlled lands for their explicit republicanism. Their platform, outside of federalism and republican democracy, expouses progressive social and political views from land and education reform to elected assemblies for all government levels.§!"

While the League attracted fairly little attention, it became Chen's formal coalition in the Guangdong Provincial Assembly. The league is wide and unwieldy, containing federalists of all colours, Kuomintang remnants, business and gentry interests, and even syndicalists. With the collapse of the League, the coalition is on the verge of collapse as they barely share a common platform in maintaing stability in Guangdong, let alone republicanism.§!"

Founded in 1912, the businessmen of the city organized and funded their own self-defence capabilities as the province descended into warlordism and banditry. The Merchant Corps rose up against the Kuomintang in 1924, convinced that they were spreading syndicalism, but were utterly crushed. Chen Lianbo, its leader from the beginning, fled to Hong Kong, only returning after the failed Northern Expedition. As part of Chen Jiongming's coalition, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and its paramilitary represent business interests in the province, their anti-union stance forcing the coalition to water-down progressive legislation, creating great tension.§!"

Although the LSDP commanded great influence over the Lithuanian independence movement, it was forced out of the Council of Lithuania due to its republican stances, an act which many hold grudges for ever since. In the independent Kingdom of Lithuania, they have moderated their anti-monarchist position, but its condition as an anti-German, anti-capitalist party has allowed it to become a big tent movement for the Lithuanian left wing. The core of the party is influenced by the German SPD and Austromarxism, and while it remains a democratic party at heart, it does not disdain socialist or outright Syndicalist influence.

Based in Petrograd, this party campaigned for Lithuania's future as a democratic republic and tied its future with the Entente, believing that Russian victory in the Eastern Front and Lithuanian autonomy within a greater Russian federation would be the best outcome for Lithuania as a whole. This never came to be, however, and Santara was thus cast out of any influence in building the foundations of the Kingdom. Santara is commonly known as the 'party of veterans'. Its leaders all became involved in politics before the Weltkrieg and were invited to hold ministries in various past governments, but the party does not command nearly as much influence among the population.

A leading proponent of conservatism and monarchism in the Lithuanian political arena, it laid down the foundations for the Kingdom of Lithuania and has remained an extremely influential party since. Because of its vast size, the party has several distinct wings - some of its members are more willing to endorse liberal ideas and reconcile with the left, others are not; some see Lithuania's future as a loyal disciple of Germany, some are wary of being constantly reigned over by godless Lutherans, others are more nationalistic. Some are influenced by Christian corporatism or even Christian socialism, others are staunch conservatives or free market proponents.

The failure of the Memel Uprising of 1928 taught Smetona that militant resistance against the Germans is futile, freedom from their grasp can only be achieved through the ballot, thus the Nationalist Union disdains any talks of armed rebellion and instead seek to implement their ideas (mostly) democratically. It believes in the need of a strong executive, in corporatist and state controlled economics, support for Lithuanian nationalism, and the ever present slogan of 'Lithuania for Lithuanians!'.

Historically one of the dominant parties of the Third Republic, they are economically and socially liberal, strongly attached to parliamentarism, and secular in the extreme, bordering on anti-clericalism even after the rise in Catholic fervor since the Exile. Of the old major parties, they suffered the worst from the Defeat, the Civil War, and the Exile. Indeed, the left wing of the party initially supported the revolution, before being marginalised by more radical leftists. As such, the party lost the trust of their liberal, educated middle- and upper-class voting base.§!"

Its ideology can be summarised with one quote by Charles Maurras, its most influential theorist: “In order to love France today, it is necessary to hate what she has become.” The aim of the Integralists is nothing less than the fall of the Republic and the establishment of an integralist state: an absolute, hereditary, anti-parliamentary, reactionary, counter-revolutionary, heavily decentralised, corporatist, and above all Catholic monarchy, protective of local identities and modelled after the traditional institutions of the Kingdom of France. Though it couldn’t be called a party, after all the group openly advocates for a coup d’état and has never participated in elections, the AF has created a surprisingly broad network of influence among Catholics radicalised by the anticlerical violence of the revolution, in intellectual circles, and, most importantly, within the military.§!"
